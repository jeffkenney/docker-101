## What are Containers?

.col-left-40[
![containers](img/containers.png)
]

.col-right-60[
- self-contained, isolated applications
- each container gets its own:
    - root filesystem and mounts
        - `/var`, `/etc`, `/mnt`, ...
    - process tree
        - `pid 1`
    - network stack
        - full set of ports, IP addresses
    - users
        - `root`
- provided by Linux kernel: **[namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces)**
]

## What are Containers?

.col-left-40[
![containers](img/containers.png)
]

.col-right-60[
- each container can have resource limits imposed on it
- provided by Linux kernel: **[cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups)**


- processes in containers can run with fine-grained superuser privileges rather than having to run as root
- provided by Linux kernel: **[capabilities](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Capabilities)**

## What are Containers?

.col-left-40[
![containers](img/containers.png)
]

.col-right-60[
**Typically, containers:**
  - consist of application code + all binaries and libraries required to run an application
  - run **one** process: the application
  - do **not** run a full operating system
    - while they can contain they same binaries as a full Linux distribution, there is no `init` system to handle process management and run background services
]

---

## Why Containers?

- no need to run multiple VMs with multiple OS installs just to run an app in production
- all environments run the code in the same execution environment
- continuous integration
    - The tests can be run in the same execution environment that the code will run in
- local development
    - Can run containers with external app dependencies to reduce need of shared dev dependencies (databases)
    - Can run multiple different versions of the same thing (e.g. different versions of Postgres for different apps)

## What is Docker?

.col-left-40[
![docker](img/docker-vertical.png)]

.col-right-60[
**Docker**

_noun_

1. A platform for running containers
1. The company of the same name
]

## Installation

- macOS
    - https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg
- Windows
    - https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi

---

## Components of Docker

**Docker Engine**

- The container runtime - allows running containers anywhere... with a Linux kernel
- Virtual machines required to run containers on macOS or Windows (Docker does this automatically)

**Images**

- "An image is a lightweight, stand-alone, **executable package** that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files."

**Containers**

- "A container is a **runtime instance** of an image â€“ what the image becomes in memory when actually executed."

## Docker Lifecycle

![lifecycle](img/lifecycle.png)

## Docker Images

.col-left-40[
![container layers](img/container-layers.jpg)
]

.col-right-60[
- pre-built filesystem comprised of multiple layers
- bottom layer is a base image
    - usually based on an OS (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
    - sets up the root filesystem
- other layers added during application installs, etc.
- all layers are read-only
    - containers get a new writable layer when running
    - files copied to the writable layer when modified
]

---

## Docker Images

Image layers are shared across all containers on a system

![sharing layers](img/sharing-layers.jpg)

---

## Docker Images

**Creating Images**
- built from a **Dockerfile** (covered in the next section)

**Distribution**
- versioned with **tags**
- stored in and downloaded from **repositories** (like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/))

**Commands**
- `docker images` -- show all images on the system
- `docker save` -- save an image to a `.tar` file (for copying between systems)
- `docker load` -- load a `.tar` file containing an image into the Docker engine
- `docker rmi` -- delete an image

---

## Dockerfile

- A plaintext file containing instructions for building an image

.col-left-50[
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest

RUN apt-get update

COPY ./index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/

ENV DOCKER_IS_AWESOME=true

EXPOSE 80

# USER nginx

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
]

.col-right-50[
**FROM**: specify the base image to be used

**RUN**: run a command during the build process

**COPY**: copy a file from the host into the image

**ENV**: set an environment variable

**EXPOSE**: open a port when running the container

**USER**: the user to run all further directives as (default root)

**CMD**: the command to run when running the image as a container
]

---

## Building An Image From A Dockerfile

**Command:** `docker build <build context dir>`
- builds an image from Dockerfile commands
- builds a layer for each Dockerfile command, and encapsulates them into a final image
    - image layers are cached, so if the Dockerfile command used to build that layer doesn't change, it doesn't have to rebuild that layer
- executes within a **build context** directory
    - Dockerfile `COPY` directives are relative to the build context
    - the only files available for Docker to copy in are the files in the build context

## Docker Containers

.col-left-50[
![container layers](img/container-layers.jpg)
]

.col-right-50[
- running instances of an image
- run a single process as `pid 1`
    - will stop when that process exits
- use the read-only filesystem layers from the image and add a writable layer
    - this layer persists when the container is stopped and restarted
]

---

## Running Containers

**Command:** `docker run [options] <image> [command]`
- `-it` -- interactive with TTY
- `-d` -- as a background process
- `-p <host>:<container>` -- map a host port to a container port
- `<image>` - an image ID or tag
- `[command]` - an optional command to run (overrides the `CMD` Dockerfile directive)

---

## Docker Containers

**Commands**
- `docker stop` -- stop a running container
- `docker start`-- start a stopped container
    - don't need to respecify port mappings, etc.
- `docker restart` -- restart a running container
- `docker ps` -- list running containers (`-a` to also list stopped containers)
- `docker attach` -- attach to the TTY of a running container (think `tmux`)
    - `Ctrl + P + Q` to detach
- `docker top` -- view the list of all processes running in a container
- `docker exec` -- execute a new process in a running container
- `docker rm` -- delete a container
